To create a bash script that performs these actions, you can use the following steps:

Open a text editor and create a new file.
Add the following lines to the file:

!/bin/bash

# Add all changed files to the staging area
git add .

# Prompt the user for a commit message
read -p "Enter commit message: " commitMessage

# Commit the changes with the commit message
git commit -m "$commitMessage"

# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin <remote repository URL>

# Push the changes to the remote repository
git push origin master



Save the file with a .sh extension, for example push.sh.


Make the file executable by running the following command: chmod +x push.sh


To run the script, navigate to the directory where it is saved and run it using ./push.sh.


This script will add all changed files to the staging area, prompt the user for a commit message, commit the changes with the provided message, add the remote repository, and push the changes to the remote repository.
